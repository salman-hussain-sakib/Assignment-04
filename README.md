# JavaScript Questions

# 1. Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, querySelector

getElementById finds one element using id.
getElementsByClassName finds many elements using class.
querySelector finds first matching element.
querySelectorAll finds all matching elements.

# 2. Creating element in DOM

We use createElement and appendChild to add new element.

# 3. Event Bubbling

Event goes from child to parent when clicked.

# 4. Event Delegation

We add event on parent instead of many children to save code.

# 5. preventDefault vs stopPropagation

preventDefault stops browser action.
stopPropagation stops event moving to parent.
